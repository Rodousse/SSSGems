This project is an implementation of the subsurface scattering on openGL
provided by GPU Gems books
see the following [link](http://developer.download.nvidia.com/books/HTML/gpugems/gpugems_ch16.html)

The aim is to update my knowledge of openGL and have a fast implementation of a feature before vulkan integration
